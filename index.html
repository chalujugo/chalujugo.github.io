                <p>i'm chalu, and i'm a 22 year old penultimate year computer science and statistics student in auckland, new zealand. i'm very keen on learning more about the tech industry and i have a strong interest in software development, data science, UX/UI design, web design, and iOS app development.
                <p> i'm from the philippines and have worked in freelance graphic design and illustration, as well as working as a creative intern for ad agency in my gap year. i finished the last two years of high school in malaysia before moving to new zealand for university. i love digital art and while i'm studying something completely different, i still draw whenever i can and am constantly trying to develop my skills!
        
                <p>i love muay thai, drawing, playing guitar, running, reading books, making and drinking coffee, and binge watching tv shows. the x files is my favorite show, and i kind of believe in aliens.</p>

In 2019, i graduated from the International Bacclaureatte Program at St. Joseph's Institution International Malaysia with a Group 4 Graduate Award in the Arts. I also qualified for the World Scholar's Cup championships in Yale University back in 2018 where I took home over 15 medals and placed 7th overall scholar at a district level. I went to high school in the Philippines and left with Bronze Honours, and a major highlight was being selected for the Tokyo Tech Exchange Program.

                <img src="img/full-comic.jpg" class="project_img">
                <p>A vintage-style comic influenced by a poster I saw while in Portugal: “All feelings are valid. Every single one.” It delivers the message that being emotional is not a negative trait and we should not be afraid to express our feelings. The text aspect of comic strips as well as my literal interpretation of each part of the saying allowed me to create artwork that directly states its own message.</p>

                <!--- Portfolio item-->
                    <img src="img/full-records.JPG" class="project_img">
                <p>A faux music record cover project inspired by my visit to a vinyl record store where I noticed how much a cover design can say about an album, and how much meaning the lyrics in that album can convey. I chose real songs for the back of the cover with titles I felt described the symptoms and manifestations of each disorder. The playful designs and bright colors eliminate the stigma that is normally attached to mental disorders.</p>

                <p>A triptych with hands that I worked on to practice drawing hands and shadows. Inspired by celestial and mystical aesthetics, each hand has a different "theme" with different surroundings in each illustration.</p>
