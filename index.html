                <!--- Portfolio item-->
                <img src="img/full-comic.jpg" class="project_img">
                <p>A vintage-style comic influenced by a poster I saw while in Portugal: “All feelings are valid. Every single one.” It delivers the message that being emotional is not a negative trait and we should not be afraid to express our feelings. The text aspect of comic strips as well as my literal interpretation of each part of the saying allowed me to create artwork that directly states its own message.</p>

                <!--- Portfolio item-->
                    <img src="img/full-records.JPG" class="project_img">
                <p>A faux music record cover project inspired by my visit to a vinyl record store where I noticed how much a cover design can say about an album, and how much meaning the lyrics in that album can convey. I chose real songs for the back of the cover with titles I felt described the symptoms and manifestations of each disorder. The playful designs and bright colors eliminate the stigma that is normally attached to mental disorders.</p>
                <!--- Portfolio item-->
                    <img src="img/hands.png" class="project_img">
                <p>A triptych with hands that I worked on to practice drawing hands and shadows. Inspired by celestial and mystical aesthetics, each hand has a different "theme" with different surroundings in each illustration.</p>
                <!--- Portfolio item-->
                    <img src="img/clothes-study.png" class="project_img">
                <p>A clothing/pose study I did to work on illustrationg how clothes fall on bodies. Two of the three are <s>slightly</s> heavily influenced by Mulder and Scully from the X-Files in a modern-day setting (hence, the FBI jackets)</p>
